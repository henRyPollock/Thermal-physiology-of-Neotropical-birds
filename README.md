Appendix 1 Table S1. Taxonomic information, ecological data, and thermal physiological data for the 89 focal species of tropical birds sampled in Panama, 
including the species’ common and scientific name, family, order; their preferred habitat type and, for forest species, 
vertical stratum; mean ± SE for body mass, upper and lower critical temperatures, and heat tolerance limit; species values for 
thermoneutral zone breadth, thermal safety margin, and warming tolerance; and sample sizes for UCT, LCT, TNZ breadth, and HTL.
